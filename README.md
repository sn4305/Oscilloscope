# Oscilloscope

Oscilloscope software project emulating a real analog [oscilloscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscilloscope) done with Python 3 and PyQt5. Originally completed as a final project work for a programming course and later improved upon a little on my own time. Supports wav audio files and csv text files for signal input. I had plans for converting the project to C++ and switching to OpenGL for drawing the signals at some point but it remains on my _to-do_ list...                 

The folder _Signals_ contains a wide variety of test signals as well as the MATLAB script I made for producing them all.          

The _build_ folder includes a ready executable for Windows so you don't necessarily have to install PyQt and Qt just to try it ;)
