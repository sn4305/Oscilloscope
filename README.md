# Oscilloscope

Oscilloscope software project emulating a real analog [oscilloscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscilloscope) done with Python 3 and PyQt5. Originally completed as a final project work for a programming course and later improved upon a little on my own time. Supports wav audio files and csv files for signal input. I had plans for converting the project to C++ and switching to OpenGL for drawing the signals at some point but it remains on my _to-do_ list...                 

The folder _Signals_ contain a wide variety of test signals as well as the MATLAB script I created for producing them.          

The _build_ folder includes an executable for Windows ;)
